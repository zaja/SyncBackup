**Author:** Goran Zajec  
**Website:** https://svejedobro.hr

## üìã Overview

SyncBackup v1.2 is an advanced Python Tkinter application for folder synchronization and backup with automatic scheduling capabilities, file retention policy, SQLite database, system tray functionality, and comprehensive dashboard monitoring.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üìä Dashboard
- **Real-time Statistics**: Total jobs, active jobs, backup sizes, success rates
- **Next Backup Info**: Shows which job runs next and when
- **Recent Activity**: Last 24 hours of job executions with status indicators
- **Auto-refresh**: Updates every 30 seconds automatically

### üîÑ Job Types

#### **Simple Job**
- Creates a complete copy of the source folder with datetime suffix
- Each execution creates a new backup folder (e.g., `folder_20251002_090326`)
- **ZIP Compression**: Option to compress backups as ZIP files for space saving
- **File Exclusion**: Exclude specific files/folders using patterns (e.g., .git, node_modules)
- **Desktop Notifications**: Optional notifications when jobs complete

#### **Incremental Job**
Incremental jobs work with **two different concepts**:

1. **üîÑ Sync Directory** (Working Copy):
   - Location: `destination/source_folder_name/`
   - Purpose: Maintains an up-to-date synchronized copy of the source folder
   - Behavior: Updated incrementally with each job execution
   - **Not displayed** in Backup Files tab (it's a sync, not a backup)

2. **üì∏ Snapshots** (Archive Copies):
   - Location: `destination/source_folder_name_INCREMENTAL_20251002_090326/`
   - Purpose: Preserves the state at specific points in time
   - Behavior: Created periodically based on the snapshot interval
   - **Displayed** in Backup Files tab (these are actual backup files)

**Options:**
- **Preserve deleted files**: Keep files in sync directory even if deleted from source
- **Create snapshots**: Enable/disable periodic snapshot creation
- **Snapshot interval**: How often to create snapshots (hours/days/weeks)
- **File Exclusion**: Exclude specific files/folders using patterns
- **Desktop Notifications**: Optional notifications when jobs complete

**Important:** Only snapshots appear in the Backup Files tab, not the sync directory. This is by design - the sync directory is a working copy, while snapshots are archive backups for recovery purposes.

### ‚è∞ Advanced Scheduler
- **Every X minutes**: Run every X minutes
- **Every X hours**: Run every X hours
- **Daily**: Daily run at specified time
- **Weekly**: Weekly run on specified day
- **Monthly**: Monthly run on specified day

### üñ•Ô∏è GUI Interface
- **Dashboard**: Statistics overview with job counts, backup sizes, success rates, and recent activity
- **Jobs List**: TreeView with columns (Name, Type, Source, Destination, Schedule, Status, Running, Last Run, Next Run)
- **Log Viewer**: Real-time log display with filter options
- **Backup Files**: View and manage backup files
- **Tab Interface**: Organized display (Dashboard, Jobs, Logs, Backup Files)

### üîß Control Buttons
- **New Job**: Create new job (always visible)
- **Edit Selected**: Edit selected job (Jobs tab only)
- **Delete Job**: Delete job (Jobs tab only)
- **Open Destination**: Open destination folder in file explorer (Jobs tab only)
- **Activate Job**: Activate job (green color, Jobs tab only)
- **Deactivate Job**: Deactivate job (red color, Jobs tab only)
- **Run Selected**: Run selected job (brown color, Jobs tab only)

**Note:** Job control buttons are only visible when the Jobs tab is active for better UI organization.

### üîΩ System Tray Functionality
- **Minimize to tray**: Application minimizes to system tray
- **Tray menu**: Show/Quit options
- **X button**: Shows quit dialog before closing
- **Background operation**: Application runs in background

### üîí Single Instance
- **File locking**: Ensures only one application instance runs
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, Linux and macOS
- **Automatic cleanup**: Automatic lock file cleanup

## ‚öôÔ∏è Additional Features

### File Exclusion Patterns
Exclude specific files/folders from backup. Examples:
- `.git,node_modules,__pycache__`
- `*.tmp,*.log,Thumbs.db`
- `cache/*,temp/*`

### ZIP Compression
Available only for Simple jobs. Compresses backup as ZIP file for space saving.

- **Success**: Green notification with file count
- **Error**: Red notification with error description
- **Skipped**: Yellow notification (no changes)

### File Retention Policy
Automatic deletion of old backups:
- **Keep Count**: Keep last N backups
- **Keep Days**: Keep backups for N days
- **Keep Size**: Keep up to N MB

## üóÉÔ∏è Database

The application uses SQLite database (`app/sync_backup.db`) for:
- Job configurations
- Hash values for change detection
- Execution logs
- Backup file tracking
- Retention policy rules

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Job Not Running
- Check if job is active
- Check "Next Run" column
- Look at logs for errors

### Empty Backup
- Check if source folder exists
- Check read/write permissions
- Check exclude patterns

### Application Won't Start
- Check if all modules are installed
- Run from command prompt to see errors
- Check Python version (3.7+)
